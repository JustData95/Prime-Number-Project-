# Prime-Number-Project-
This is a simple prime number generator that attempts to implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes Algorithm. 

# Overview 
The purpose of this project was to create a prime number generator that could produce up to two million primes. In addition, this personal pursuit was implemented such that one could understand the introductory syntax of the Python language. Finally, throughout this document, there will be an accumulation of theory and code explanations that will be explored in detail. 

  **Tasks:**
  
•	Understanding various prime number generators, each, with different methods

•	Flowchart Creation

•	Optimization of Code 

• Implementing the  Sieve of Eratosthenes Code 

•	Technical write-up

# Essay Disclaimer 
My essay has a lot of errors and perhaps doesn't make sense. Figures 3 and 7 are not my code, it was found on stack overflow.  It is my first attempt to write a technical document. Additionally, here are the things that I I can improve on for my essay for my next project: 

  **1.** Proper Havard Referencing
  
  **2.** Referencing other's code in the technical write-up
  
  **3.** Using different font style for code so that it can ensure user-readability
